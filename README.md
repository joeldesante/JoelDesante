### About Me
I like to consider my self as a full stack developer (with a concentration in web technologies). I'm always learning new things and coming up with new ideas. Creating things that people want to use in my goal, whether it be physical or digital.

### Current Status
I am currently a Computer Science student at Old Dominion University.
